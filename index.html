      <h2>Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs (1937)</h2>
      <p>There’s no better place to start than with Disney’s first animated feature. This movie served as a template for so many other animated films from both Disney and its rivals. This film’s technological breakthrough was the multiplane camera, a massive device that allowed the camera to “move” through images of a forest or the forbidding castle where the Evil Queen plots the eponymous maiden’s murder. Multiple animation cels (or images) were set up for each complex shot, making Snow White look as much like a movie as the live-action fare of the era did. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs isn’t the gold standard of the Disney fairy tale, but you can’t understand the studio without seeing how it all started. </p>

      <h2>Fantasia (1940)</h2>
      <p>Each short in Fantasia allowed animators to flex their creative muscles. Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker Suite inspired the dancing flowers and mushrooms in the segment with that soundtrack, while The Rite of Spring describes nothing less than the evolution of life on Earth. (Fantasia isn’t free of controversy: A group of Black female centaurs was removed from the original cut in the 1960s because they were depicted as servile.) But Fantasia failed to hit big initially. One reason it took so long to make a profit was that Walt Disney wanted a sound system installed in all theaters that was too expensive at the time. Dubbed Fantasound, it was stereo sound decades before the world was ready for it. Eighty years later, Fantasia is distinctive and remarkable, showcasing truly jaw-dropping animation. </p>

      <h2>The Reluctant Dragon (1941)</h2>
      <p>Beforehand, we’re treated to comic gadfly Robert Benchley traversing the studio lot. He’s ostensibly there to see if Walt wants to adapt “The Reluctant Dragon,” but first he takes a tour of everything from the recording booths (where he meets Clarence Nash, the voice of Donald Duck) to the storyboard rooms to where cast members mixed paint colors. The Reluctant Dragon also shows off the multiplane camera, the creation of sound effects for Dumbo, and more Disney magic. The film was released during a contentious animators strike, in which they demanded fairer wages and better labor practices; at the time, this self-driven love letter struck the wrong note. In context 80 years later, The Reluctant Dragon is a valuable, lo-fi look at how the sausage was made. </p>

      <h2>The Three Caballeros (1944)</h2>
      <p>The Three Caballeros, like all Disney package films, has its ups and downs. After an early stretch in which Donald watches a few “home movies,” he’s pulled into the action by his fellow caballeros, José Carioca and Panchito Pistoles, and the movie comes to life. Even with its lower budget, The Three Caballeros is delightfully outlandish. The final section, titled “Donald’s Surreal Reverie,” shows the very horny duck drooling after women, and we see the caballeros’ heads on real women’s bodies and other daffy images. Few Disney films are so singularly baffling and charming at once.</p>

      <h2>Cinderella (1950)</h2>
      <p>Cinderea isn’t as fancifully animated as the studio’s earlier efforts, but there are flashes of the hallucinatory quality of the “Pink Elephants on Parade” segment of Dumbo. Consider “Sing, Sweet Nightingale,” a lullaby depicting the young maiden inside the soap bubbles she’s using to scrub the stairs. And few scenes in Disney animation rival the magical climax when Cinderella transforms into a beautiful princess with the help of her Fairy Godmother. Cinderella isn’t groundbreaking, but sometimes the basics are enough.</p>

      <h2>Sleeping Beauty (1959)</h2>
      <p>Sleeping Beauty was the last true masterwork released during Walt Disney’s lifetime. The story is deceptively simple, but the way the animators create moving pictures to mimic medieval-style stained glass is singular. The film’s emotional arc mirrors the effect of the sleeping potion that overtakes Aurora and the denizens of the kingdom: Sleeping Beauty has a dreamlike quality as it drifts from one setpiece to the next until the climactic battle between Prince Phillip and the primally terrifying Maleficent-as-dragon. Disney bet the farm on Sleeping Beauty, and it paid off. This is one of the all-time great animated features, period.</p>

      <h2>One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961))</h2>
      <p>One Hundred and One Dalmatians was a major shift for Disney as the studio’s first animated feature set in the present day. One of its most memorable images is a shot of scads of Dalmatian puppies watching a black-and-white TV set, a nod to the times. The film is also host to one of Disney’s most outlandish, disturbing villainesses, Cruella De Vil, who’s as evil as she sounds. From a visual standpoint, One Hundred and One Dalmatians isn’t as lush or colorful as Sleeping Beauty, but it’s a fun romp in which the technology matches the story.</p>

      <h2>The Jungle Book (1967)</h2>
      <p>While The Jungle Book has painterly touches and great character animation, a crash course in Disney’s animated features must also acknowledge that some of the studio’s films include troubling depictions of nonwhite cultures. The Jungle Book is one such example, indulging in old-fashioned racism and sexism unhesitatingly. On Disney+, there’s a brief warning of offensive content, but the content is still jarring.</p>

      <h2>The Rescuers (1977)</h2>
      <p>The Rescuers was the last true gasp for the elder statesmen of Disney, as they offered this grim adaptation of Margery Sharp’s daring rescue story. Depending on your point of view, this is an exciting adventure in which two mice rescue an orphan from a greedy kidnapper, or it’s a bleak tragedy in which a little girl is so lost that only mice can save her. Either way, The Rescuers boasts impressively dark animated tableaux and fun, off-kilter chemistry between leads voiced by Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor. But as the studio continued leaning into darkness, it wound up alienating some audiences and animators.</p>

      <h2>The Black Cauldron (1985)</h2>
      <p>The Black Cauldron can’t decide if it wants to be an ’80s-era fantasy like Krull or Excalibur, or … you know, a “Disney movie.” On one hand: undead soldiers attacking the good guys. On the other: a chatty comic-relief sidekick asking for “munchies and crunchies.” The Black Cauldron has fertile source material and some memorable images, but it was too schizophrenic to succeed.</p>

      <h2>The Little Mermaid (1989)</h2>
      <p>The film’s co-directors, John Musker and Ron Clements, cut their teeth on The Great Mouse Detective before telling the story of Ariel, a passionate teenager who wants to spend time on dry land after she falls in love with the dashing Prince Eric. The true secret ingredient of The Little Mermaid is lyricist Howard Ashman; he and composer Alan Menken made their Disney debut with this film in melodically marvelous fashion. The songs are vastly indebted to the rich legacy of Broadway musicals, with “Part of Your World” functioning as an “I Want”–style number in which our heroine explains her innermost desires, and “Poor Unfortunate Souls” serving as the sea witch Ursula’s mission statement. Ashman and Menken’s songs are instantly unforgettable and necessary parts of the story.</p>

      <h2>The Lion King (1994)</h2>
      <p>The Lion King isn’t Disney’s greatest work — its structure is lopsided, making it so neither the young nor the adult Simba feels fully fleshed out — but it boasts gorgeous animation and some complex characterizations. Jeremy Irons delivers one of his best performances as Simba’s uncle, Scar, whose loathing for his family leads him to stage a coup and rule the Pride Lands into ruin. The Lion King was ambitious, hinting at future Disney Renaissance titles that attempted to balance the epic and the silly.</p>

      <h2>Dinosaur (2000)</h2>
      <p>Dinosaur is the story of an iguanodon and his adoptive family of lemurs traveling to safety in prehistoric times. The film’s most distinctive technical choice is to superimpose computer-animated characters against live-action backgrounds. Arguably, it’s easier to convince audiences of the reality of a situation if the characters are traversing real places. But the animation in Dinosaur doesn’t stand the test of time, and the story is wan and forgettable. Like The Lion King, Dinosaur was promoted in advance with a teaser version of its opening, in which a dinosaur egg travels down rushing waters. But Dinosaur goes downhill after this opening. The film is an effective warning: Animating a story via computer doesn’t replace good dialogue and memorable characters.</p>

      <h2>Chicken Little (2005)</h2>
      <p>Arriving a decade after Toy Story, Chicken Little was Disney’s first fully computer-animated feature. Strangely, this film feels inspired by an outside rival: DreamWorks’ Shrek. Like Shrek, Chicken Little is replete with pop-culture references, cameos, and needle drops. Also like Shrek, Chicken Little has some particularly grim-looking computer animation. The character design is garish, and coming opposite Finding Nemo and The Incredibles, it’s easy to see why Chicken Little was less a path forward for the studio than a rough first attempt at embracing the future.</p>

      <h2>The Princess and the Frog (2009)</h2>
      <p>This riff on “The Frog Prince” focuses on Tiana (Anika Noni Rose) — a hardworking young woman in 1920s New Orleans who is saving up to open a restaurant — and the misadventure she embarks upon after turning into a frog. The Princess and the Frog is a modern pinnacle of Disney animation. With songs by Randy Newman, the film boasts the same showstopping Broadway-style music of the Disney Renaissance, coupled with a rare romance in which both partners are fully characterized and developed. The budding relationship between Tiana and her beau, Prince Naveen, works because, as with Beauty and the Beast, both characters get enough screen time to make you believe they would fall in love at all. The Princess and the Frog might have stumbled at the box office, but it’s an incredible curtain call for Disney’s hand-drawn days.</p>

      <h2>Zootopia (2016)</h2>
      <p>Zootopia is deft, funny, and the most richly animated film the studio has made in years. Goodwin and Bateman are a hilarious team, and the pacing is crisp enough to stand next to live-action action movies. The film’s attempts to draw parallels to racism in the real world are the big stumble, highlighting how parallels between animals and humans go only so far. But the story, inventive humor, and emotionally deep voice performances make Zootopia a fine closer to this crash course.</p>
